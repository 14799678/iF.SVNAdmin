	The iF.SVNAdmin application is a web based GUI to your Subversion authorization file.
	It is based on PHP 5.3 and requires a web server (Apache) to be installed. The application 
	doesn’t need a database back end or anything similar, it completely based on the Subversion 
	authorization- and user authentication file. (Inludes LDAP support for users and groups)
