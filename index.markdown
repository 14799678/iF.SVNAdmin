The iF.SVNAdmin application is a web based GUI to your 
[Subversion authorization file.](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch06s04.html#svn-ch-6-sect-4.4.2) 
It is based on [PHP 5.3](http://www.php.net/) and requires a web server (Apache) 
to be installed. The application doesnâ€™t need a database back end or anything 
similar, it completely based on the Subversion authorization- and user 
authentication file. (Inludes LDAP support for users and groups)
