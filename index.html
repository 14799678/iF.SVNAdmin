	The iF.SVNAdmin application is a web based GUI to your 
	<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch06s04.html#svn-ch-6-sect-4.4.2">Subversion authorization file.</a>
	It is based on <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP 5.3</a> and requires a web server (Apache) 
	to be installed. The application doesnâ€™t need a database back end or anything 
	similar, it completely based on the Subversion authorization- and user 
	authentication file. (Inludes LDAP support for users and groups)
