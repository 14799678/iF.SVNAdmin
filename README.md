iF.SVNAdmin - REBUILD
=====================
IN DEVELOPMENT - Do not use!


Development
-----------
The following file based structure is required to run this development version:

- WWW-Root/
 - svnadmin/
 - humble-rest-framework-php/ (https://github.com/mfreiholz/humble-rest-framework-php)

The entire project is based on the ``humble-rest-framework-php``, which is another GitHub project from me.
It doesn't require any configuration at all. The release builds, will contain the framework in iF.SVNAdmin's ``thirdparty`` folder.
